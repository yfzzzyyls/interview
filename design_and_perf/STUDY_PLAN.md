# RTL Design + Architecture Interview Prep Plan (3 Weeks)

## Context
Targeting **RTL Design Engineer** and **CPU/IP Architect** roles at big tech (Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm). Full-time study (6-8 hrs/day). Graduating May 2026.

**Strengths**: 4 years RISC-V CPU architecture + perf modeling, strong architecture conceptual knowledge, basic RTL fundamentals done (modules 01-08 in `/home/fy2243/coding/rtl/`).

**Critical gaps**: No CDC, no async FIFO, no bus protocols (AXI), no pipeline with hazards, no UART/SPI from scratch, no arbiter, no SRAM design. Architecture knowledge needs interview-level depth and fluency.

**What this plan does NOT cover (intentionally)**: UVM/verification, low power design, formal verification, generic LeetCode (DP/graphs), PCIe/DDR protocols, GPU architecture, SystemC/HLS, physical design tool flow, C/C++ coding practice.

## Daily Structure
- **Morning (3-4 hrs)**: Primary — learn concept, then code RTL module + testbench
- **Afternoon (2-3 hrs)**: Architecture concept study OR additional RTL module
- **Evening (1 hr)**: Spaced repetition — re-code a previous module from scratch, closed-book
- **Mastery test**: Can you code it on a blank screen in 45 min with no reference? If not, it's not learned.
- **Quick quizzes**: After each topic, do 3-5 concept-check questions before moving on. These catch gaps that coding alone misses (e.g., "why must FIFO depth be power of 2?", "what's the latency of a 2-FF synchronizer?"). Quiz before code, quiz after code.
